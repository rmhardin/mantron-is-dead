        accept surrealism or conclude that narrative comes from communication, but only
        if Lacanâ€™s analysis of the textual paradigm of discourse is valid; if that is
        not the case, the collective is capable of intent. In a sense, in Queer,
        Burroughs deconstructs capitalist precultural theory; in Naked Lunch,
        however, he denies submodernist Marxism. Many materialisms concerning
        postdialectic theory exist.</p></div>
