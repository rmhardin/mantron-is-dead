# Rachel Hardin: Code Louisville Front End Project SP2018

## Description
```
This project is a simple website for a friend who is currently on hiatus from live-streaming video games. He is hoping to return soon, and this site will offer a simple way for his fans to interact with him and check on his status. Because of his sudden disappearance from streaming, there is a running joke that he is dead, so the site plays off of that.
